## FREE TIER USERS ##
# Oracle configured your account for two free virtual machines in a specific cloud REGION + AD (Availability Domain), terraform needs to know these.
# See which REGION + AD oracle assigned to your account with the following two commands (without the #):

# OCI_TENANCY_OCID=$(oci iam compartment list --all --compartment-id-in-subtree true --access-level ACCESSIBLE --include-root --raw-output --query "data[?contains(\"id\",'tenancy')].id | [0]")
# oci limits value list --compartment-id $OCI_TENANCY_OCID --service-name compute --query "data [?contains(\"name\",'standard-e2-micro-core-count')]" --all

# Example output - look at each "value" and find the 2 (thats the two free virtual machines)
# The AD number is the last digit in "availability-domain" - 2 in this example (note - some regions only have one AD)
